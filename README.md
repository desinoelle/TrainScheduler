# TrainScheduler
# Created and Maintained by Desiree Howell
Brief Overview: This is a Train Scheduler app where the user may enter the train's name, destination, first arrival time of the day, and frequency of arrivals. All of this information is then stored in a database using Firebase and a new row is created in the Train Schedules table. The new row displays the train's name, destination, frequency of arrival, next train arrival, and minutes until the next train. I used moment.js to take the first arrival time and frequency, and then calculate the next train arrival and minutes until the next train with that information provided.
